idea on: loading announcements and pagination
    frontend keeps a counter of (total announcements currently displayed), default 0
    frontend sends (counter+10) to backend
    backend counts total announcements
        if total announcements - (counter+10) <= 0, backend sends (more: 'false')
        if total announcements - (counter+10) <= 10, backend sends (announcements: remainingAnnouncements, more: 'false)
        else (if total announcements - (counter+10) > 10)
            nextTenAnnouncements = query limit 10 offset (counter+10)
            backend sends (announcements: nextTenAnnouncements, more: 'true')

May 10 Notes
To do: Initial.js files aka migration files should be separated on each module
To do: Auth routes
To do: user table columns that depend on role should be created on separate tables i.e. user table should only contain columns related to all types of user
To do: Rebuild frontend with auth backend only

May 14 Notes
To do: Disable router component re-use. Mounted should be called on route view change
    https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#using-the-options-api
    beforeRouteEnter (to, from, next) {
        next(vm => {
            vm.mounted()
        })
    },
To do: auth.js > line 147, creating initial rows on other table such as enrollment data (for students) on register
To do: auth.js > login route > redirect different roles to different pages upon login success

idea on: loading announcements and pagination
  frontend keeps a counter of (total announcements currently displayed), default 0
  frontend sends (counter+10) to backend
  backend counts total announcements
    if total announcements - (counter+10) <= 0, backend sends (more: 'false')
    if total announcements - (counter+10) <= 10, backend sends (announcements: remainingAnnouncements, more: 'false)
    else (if total announcements - (counter+10) > 10)
      nextTenAnnouncements = query limit 10 offset (counter+10)
      backend sends (announcements: nextTenAnnouncements, more: 'true')


May 10 Notes
To do: Initial.js files aka migration files should be separated on each module
To do: Auth routes
To do: user table columns that depend on role should be created on separate tables i.e. user table should only contain columns related to all types of user
To do: Rebuild frontend with auth backend only
